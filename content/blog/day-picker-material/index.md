Material-UI has beautiful dates and time pickers 📅 It was surprising to me to find out they don't have a day-of-the-week picker too. I thought it was a common feature to schedule stuff ⏰

Anyway, I had to do some impro using the Material-UI [Toggle Button Group][toggle-button-group].

I added some custom styling to the basic Material toggle, and I loved the result 💅 A component that can be used as an input form to get the user's preferred days of the week ⭐️
