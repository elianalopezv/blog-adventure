A few months ago, I met [Commit][commit] and decided to join. I like to define Commit as the life-long partner a software engineer needs to find the best startup project match without risks. At the same time, Commit is what startups need to get the best engineers for their projects quickly.

I loved their mission and the idea of having the experience of working remotely from Colombia with worldwide people and startups. It was such a great opportunity 🙌

Now, I'm glad to have completed my first month working with these fantastic people. I would summarize this month in two words: challenging and exciting 🤠

Here are some thoughts about my journey ✅

### Week 1

I got my first challenge: deploy an application using their open-source product, [Zero][commit-zero].

It sounds like something simple. But I had to learn and try to understand a lot of new stuff quickly. Especially things about infrastructure, like the AWS ecosystem, Kubernetes, and Terraform 🤯

It wasn't easy, and it took me four days to finish it (even with a lot of help) 🙈 But in the end, you get the satisfaction of being able to solve a big challenge and get some new knowledge 💪
Also, after you understand what you did with Zero, you feel like it's something that actually could have taken 1 or 2 days at most.
For sure, that's possible only when you already fully understand what Zero does and how the technologies that Zero uses work 🧐

Although this was a satisfying experience, I have to say that I was expecting a less aggressive onboarding.
It was frustrating at some times 😨 There were times I asked myself: "Is this the job I wanted?" 🤔 I mean, I love to learn new things and to take challenges. It's just that it felt like too much on the plate, and I wasn't ready for that 🤯
It's not like I was not able to do it, but it's that I was not mentally prepared for that 😳

I was used to a different onboarding style. Where you are the newbie, so they give you the first week to know the people, set up the repo, see the project you'll be working in, understand the team workflow, and the business rules. You can start picking up an easy task from the backlog, and when you have enough amount of confidence, you can get on the boat and start showing your amazing sailing skills ⛵️😌

It was quite different. From day one, you had a big shark to swim with before you can get on the boat.
The good part is that you get into the boat with some new excellent skills at swimming 🏊‍♀💪

I would not say one onboarding style is better than the other one. Both are just different.
Now I know that I have to prepare for both ✅

_Commit_ is _committed_ to making you do _commits_ from day one. And that's great! 😉

### Week 2

This week felt more like the onboarding I was expecting initially. I had the time to test the new technologies I'll be working with, setting up the repositories, understanding the project, and picking something from the backlog 👩‍💻

However, it was a little overwhelming week because I had to split my time into the project tasks and to do the onboarding of two groups of new hires.
Again, I wasn't expecting that, and my new tasks had a lot of unknown stuff for me.
Again, I asked myself if this was what I wanted. I was feeling that this new job was demanding me more time than expected 😫

Also, I realized a new potential problem: my communication skills 🤐
I felt that I was not able to communicate my thoughts and questions effectively, and this was slowing me down 😔
By the end of the week, I was feeling insecure about the job and my performance. I was planning to ask for some feedback about this, but I decided to wait for the next week ⌛️

### Week 3

For the first time, I was able to be 100% focused on my assigned project 🤓 I was still trying to understand some stuff and going a little slow, but by the end of this week, I had completed some tasks and felt I did it better than the previous two weeks 💃🎉

### Week 4 - until now

I'm happy with my team because they're always supporting me, and I learn something new from them every day. I'm grateful for that 🙏

I'm still running into tasks I have not previous knowledge, but now I feel more confident than at the beginning, and learning these new things makes me feel great. I think I don't feel frustrated anymore because now I'm more mentally prepared and adapted 😌 Also, the team is working very well, so we're not having rushes or significant amounts of pressure. It's good because it brings the possibility to deliver on time but allowing some extra time to learn and experiment 🧪✨ Not just make code blindly that works without knowing why.

I still feel insecure about my communication skills and even making some mistakes, so I keep working on it 🛠

Now, I remember why I wanted to join Commit. I enjoy learning new things and not limiting myself to do always the same tasks 😴 Commit is bringing to me the possibility to learn faster than any other company, and it's fascinating not knowing what you'll need to learn next to help to build a new startup product idea 🤩 Hopefully, one of those startups will become my next exciting adventure. And Commit will be there as the home you can always return 🏡
