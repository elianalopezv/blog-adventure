Surfing the [CodePen][codepen] site, it's easy to find stunning designs made with pure HTML + CSS. It's even relaxing to see some of them. They're just perfect! ðŸ¤©

I've seen some basic CSS draws lately, and I realized that if you spend enough time on it, you can accomplish a beautiful design ðŸ’…
So, I decided to start with an easy one. Here's the [result][codepen-demo] ðŸ’Ÿ

I have to say you end up practicing a lot, even if it's a basic drawing! I'm now looking forward to doing some more and include other concepts I didn't practice here, as shadows and animations! ðŸ’ƒâœ¨
