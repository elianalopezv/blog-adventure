For a non-Canadian who wants to move to Canada, getting a job offer and visa sponsorship is an important and exciting first step. But it‚Äôs only the beginning of a long journey. Fortunately, cool companies like [VanHack][vanhack] help people find a job in Canada and support the relocation process. They also help to prepare you for technical interviews until you get the job that matches your interests.

After you get the job and a company that is willing to sponsor you, you are ready to apply for a work permit visa application. So, what comes next? These are the things that I would have liked to know before starting my visa application after I got a job at [Commit][commit].

üçÅ **You need an immigration consultant.** This is not a must; you could go through the process alone and investigate by yourself. But an immigration consultant is the best information resource you can have. They will provide you with the best tips to make an application stronger and, most importantly, adapted specifically to your case. Special thanks to VanHack for providing this service.

üìÉ **The checklist is long.** You need to provide a list of documents through the official Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada [website][ircc]. They are presented as a checklist with the items you need to submit to complete your application. The checklist had 15 items for me and six for my spouse. I had to review them two or three times with my immigration consultant before submitting them. The next points include tips that would have saved me additional reviews and got things done faster.

üíº **Save your employment records and keep them up to date.** One of the strongest items in the application is the documentation that demonstrates your previous work experience. This includes employment certificates, paycheques, and clients‚Äô and employers' letters. These documents have to prove how much time you were working, your salary and your responsibilities. It's important to demonstrate at least three years of experience. The letters must also be written using the company's letterhead and contain their contact info.

This was a tedious step for me because I didn't save this documentation when I left my previous jobs, so I had to reach out to every previous employer and ask for them. Also, I had to go back and ask for corrections after the reviews with my consultant. This was easier with the startups because my bosses were also my friends, so they were very comprehensive and responded quickly. Larger companies were not as responsive because I had to first reach out to the human resources manager, then they had to ask their bosses for approval to write the letter, get authorization to use the letterhead, etc. Point for startups! üíØ

üî§ **You need to certify translations.** Suppose you have documents like your employment records, marriage certificate and diplomas in a language other than English or French. In that case, you must pay for a certified translation to one of these languages. These translations are not cheap, and the price varies with the length of the texts. So, if possible, it‚Äôs best to get documents in English directly from the issuer instead of sending them to a translator. Also, check if the translator offers a guarantee if you have to ask for corrections, so you don't have to pay twice if you need changes.

‚úç **Your contract or job offer must be specific.** I had to ask Commit for corrections three times in my contract. We didn't know how much time it would take getting visa approval, but the government requires the company to set an expected start date. They also demand a specific address as the place of work, and preferably this place is not your home, even if it's a company whose employees work remotely! I believe they need to ensure that you are required to live in Canada to perform your job tasks. That's fine, but knowing this in advance would have prevented us from signing the contract three times. Special thanks to [Tiff][tiff] and [Beier][beier] at Commit. üôà

‚òù **Bonus fact:** If the company is sponsoring through the [LMIA][lmia] program, you and your company have to pledge to giving benefits to other Canadians after you arrive in the country. In our case, we decided to make a knowledge transfer that consists of giving eight sessions of technical training to my team via webinar during my two years of residence.
